        <h1>A Brief History of the Java Language</h1>
        <p>
                The origins of Java can be traced back to the era, when the C programming revolutionized the way we look at computer programming and program structure. Before the creation of C on a DEC-PDP-11 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, the languages Fortran, Cobol, Basic and Pascal, were in wide use.  Although Fortran and Cobol were useful for building scientific applications, they were not efficient enough for building system programs. Basic, though easy to learn, lacked power, and its structure made its use questionable for large programs. Also, although languages like Pascal were structured, they were not designed for efficiency, and failed to include certain features necessary to make them applicable to a wide range of programs. Thus, due to lack of efficiency and structure, these languages were not suitable for the system-level of programming.

                The C programming language, was based on an earlier language B, which was an improved version of BCPL. BCPL was meant to be used to develop compilers for other languages. BCPL introduced several features of modern programming languages, including using curly braces to delimit code blocks; compilation via virtual machine byte code; and the world's first 'hello world' demonstrator program. Nowadays BCPL is no longer in common use.

                B was developed at Bell Labs in 1969 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. B was essentially the BCPL system stripped of any component Ken Thompson felt he could do without in order to make it fit within the memory capacity of the minicomputers of the time. But B was a problem on the PDP-11 because it was difficult to elegantly access the character data type that the PDP-11 and most modern computers fully support. Thus, B was designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine-independent applications, such as system and language software.



                Starting in 1971 Ritchie made changes to the B language while converting its compiler to produce machine code, most notably adding data typing for variables. During 1971 and 1972, B evolved into "New B" (NB) and then C. C is an procedural programming language, that was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded micro-controllers to supercomputers, and is one of the most widely used programming languages of all times. However, although C was a huge leap forward from B, large programs could not still be written fairly efficiently in C.
