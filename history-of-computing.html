        <h1>The Computing Story</h1>
        <h2>From the First Computers to the Mac and PC</h2>
        <p>
            The first computers were the simple abacus, astrolabe and the slide rule. They were rudimentary and involved tuning various needles, switches and gears. However, these machines required a great deal of time to use and were not, often accurate.

            Charles Babbage, the father of mordern computing, realised that many of these cumbersome tasks could be performed by mechanical computers. He conceptualised and invented the Analytical Engine in the 19th century. Unfortunately, the Britsh Governement ceased funding his project. His son, Henry Babbage, later completed a simplified version of the Analytical engine, and succesfully demostrated its use in computing tables in 1906. The Analytical Engine was a significant stride forward in the history of computing. It ran on programmable punch cards and the machine had a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine was also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory; making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described as Turing-complete, in mordern terms.
